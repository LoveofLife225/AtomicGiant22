 <p>Atoms... What is an atom? Take a moment to answer this question.</p>
 <p>And what is an isotope?</p>
 <p>Obviously we're talking about phenomena that clearly exist here (if you as you are right now cannot exist without the world around, then whether there is a physical world
or not, it is an illusion, it is real in your heart!)</p>
 <h2>Isotopes and Atoms.</h2>
 <h2>- Models -</h2>
<p>The simplest atom you can make is the hydrogen atom. It is made up of one tiny positive proton, and a very tiny negative electron.</p>
<p>Because of their opposite polarity they are attracted to each other.</p>
<p>What happens if you add a neutron into the nucleus with the proton? What changes?</p>
<p>Here, the charge doesn't change, so the atom acts in the same way! it's just a bit more massive, you could say it's heavier.</p>
<p>The consensus of the scientific community is to see this as not being the most important thing. If you wish to hurt others you must first classify them by something that 
is not their defining characteristic, but something you hate.</p>
<p>it is in a manner I consider similar, though you are free to reject any of this, that we don't define atoms by their mass, but by tcall something an atom if it's structure is
