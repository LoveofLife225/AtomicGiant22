   <h1>Atoms -</h1?
   <h2>Life of a Giant</h2>
 </header>
 <p>Atoms... What is an atom? Take a moment to answer this question.</p>
 <p>And what is an isotope?</p>
 <p>Obviously we're talking about phenomena that clearly exist here (if you as you are right now cannot exist without the world around, then whether there is a physical world
or not, it is an illusion, it is real in your heart!)</p>
 <h2>Isotopes and Atoms.</h2>
 <h2>- Models -</h2>
<p>The simplest atom you can make is the hydrogen atom. It is made up of one tiny positive proton, and a very tiny negative electron.</p>
<p>Because of their opposite polarity they are attracted to each other.</p>
<p>What happens if you add a neutron into the nucleus with the proton? What changes?</p>                          
<p>The charge doesn't actually change! The hydrogen atom just has more mass. You could say it's heavier.</p>
<p>Given that with this added neutron it acts very similarily to regular hydrogen we call it an isotope, a variation of the same atom.</p>
<p>But, this is just one way to view things. In Quantum Physics, it is found that these structures are actually made of quantum waves The same goes for all 
the things you see around. The table. The computers.
 <h2>You vs The World - Another way of seeing things</h2> 
<p>Before I continue, it must be said that what we will talk about is going to be but one way to see the same truth. People have various ways of talking about things
such as "Unity", or other people. It would seem that perhaps we see people trough the lens of the past. For most people, the past leads their lives and there is nothing
new. Other people are treated as potential threats or cows for milking, similarily to childhood relationships we once held.</p>
<p>I believe it is an odd way to see things to many, but I cannot speak for our friends troughout the universe. We are on an expedition towards the farthest reaches
of the world.</p> 
<p>We live very intense lives, and in my life several things have amplified the running amok of emotions. [song] My mind is lost in haze. Looking for a way out 
of this maze. I hide things, and deny this darkness so as to help you, but I am trapped by the same illusions of feeling that what people need and are is something 
I know, needing to defend against them or protect them as if I lived in a tribe 2000 years ago~</p>
<p>Still what helps you get out of your mess, is this moment always. We speak of science. Can you find where the past binds you in this moment</p>
               <p>to be continued..</p>
