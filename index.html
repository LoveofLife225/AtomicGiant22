 <h2 class = "heading">- Atoms -</h2>
 <p>Atoms... What is an atom? Take a moment to answer this question.</p>
 <p>And what is an isotope?</p>
 <p>Obviously we're talking about phenomena that clearly exist here (if you as you are right now cannot exist without the world around, then whether there is a physical world
or not, it is an illusion, it is real in your heart!)</p>
 <h2 class = "heading">Isotopes and Atoms.</h2>
 <h2 class = "heading">- Models -</h2>
<p>The simplest atom you can make is the hydrogen atom. It is made up of one tiny positive proton, and a very tiny negative electron.</p>
<p>Because of their opposite polarity they are attracted to each other.</p>
<p>What happens if you add a neutron into the nucleus with the proton? What changes?</p>                          
<p>The charge doesn't actually change! The hydrogen atom just has more mass. You could say it's heavier.</p>
<p>Given that with this added neutron it acts very similarily to regular hydrogen we call it an isotope, a variation of the same atom.</p>
<p>But, this is just one way to view things, to model the data for our understanding, you could say. In Quantum Physics, it is found that these structures are actually made of quantum waves. The same goes for all 
the things you see around. The table. The computers.</p>
 <h2 class = "heading">"All Thngs Exist In Relationship"</h2>
 <p>Nothing can exist without something else. is that true?</p>
 <p>A table can only exist if it has the floor below it to support it. Can a table exist in a vaccum in space? Maybe, but I just said that it needs the space around it.</p> 
 <p>So what is your body in relationship to right now? It is definitely in relationship with the chair. And if you drink something your hand will be in relationship to a cup,
which is holding water. The water will once it passes trough your mouth be processed by your body and turned into fuel for... your life.</p>
 <p>Ultimately, the food you eat, that you call different from your body becomes a part of your body. YOU can only exist as you are in relationship! Your body is made of the food you eat, your personality and mind act and perceive
only with an object to percieve and think about and the influence of other people upon your perception. This doesn't mean you're a slave, that's just one way to see it.</p>
 <p>You can also see it as proof that the time to change things is this moment, the time to consider and shape the future is now. You have no power outside this moment not
because you're powerless, but because you are not seeing the world correctly. If you pray to God to change the past, this is not possible because the past doesn't exist in this moment.</p>     
 <p>But, if you give to the world, wouldn't that be amazing. If you give a person without a home, someone that seems upright and sincere something without expecting anything in return, aren't you powerful.</p>
 <p>A flower receives water from the skies, formed of vapors from the seas. In exchange it gives stability to the ground, and beauty to the world.</p>  
 <p>When you are most depressed, and shameful, addicted, powerless, the key to getting your power is not to fight for yourself, but to fight for all. Go outside and let nature give to you it's quiet. 
Then, open your heart and give to someone a smile. To give something you must have. If you try to give, you will get. To quit an addiction, think not of what you mustn't do, but of what you
can do without the addiction. And if life gives you lemons, make lemonade. All good and bad things shall pass.</p>
 <p>You could, without the addiction give 10% of your money to those less fortunate than you. The rich getting richer doesn't need to be an unfair thing in, because you can help others with your
newfound power.</p>

 <p>Thank you for listening. Feel free to drop anything said here! There is so much to say about atoms. I am thankful to Veritasium for his wonderful videos on the difference between what we call atoms and isotopes! Also, thank you to 
Aaron Abke for introducing me to the concept of things existing in relationship, and "service to others". Thank you to the Sword Art Online series for introducing me to the saying "Noblesse Oblige" and of course, thank you
very much for listening, and for being! That alone inspires me sooo much.</p>
